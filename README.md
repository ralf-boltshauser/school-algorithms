# Levenshtein Distance

## Project explanation
This is my school project, where I will implement the Levenshtein distance. I will create a search bar and a distance limit. Thus the user can search through my "Products" with a certain tolerance. 

## Algorithm explanation
The levenshtein distance calculates the amount of steps that are needed to convert one string into another. There are three available actions, Replace, Delete, Insert. Based on them the algorithm generates a matrix and calculates the needed steps. It also solves all substring comparisons to find the best possible way.
